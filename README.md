# Industrial-Group-Project
Software analysis code for the PHYS 355 Lancaster University Industrial Group Project with [TFP](https://www.tfpglobal.com/)

The aim of this project is to characterise defects in PEM fuel cell materials produced by Technical Fibre Products Ltd (TFP). In particular, the presence of visually unappealing lines in the gas diffusion layers (GDL) of fuel cells has plagued particular carbon-based nonwovens manufactured by TFP. Such defects do not appear to hinder the technical performance of the GDL, yet impair the customer perception of product quality. This has called for a quantitative testing method to be devised, providing both a quantifiable determination of line severity, and a clear procedure through which future improvements can be assessed.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To complete...
The methods for this analysis are contained in `linefinder.py`, whilst the user interface can be found in `UI.py`. A database of the obtained results is collected in a .csv file, which can be opened and edited in Microsoft Excel. Finally, a collection of ineffective analysis methods can be found in the _didnt-work_ and _obsolete_ folders.

### Installation

To complete...


### Running the Code

Just run `UI.py` innit
